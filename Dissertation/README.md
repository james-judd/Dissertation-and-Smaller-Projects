Abstract:
I use phase information from the BORG Algorithm to create initial conditions, using ICGEN,
to run dark matter simulations on GADGET-3 code in search of haloes with properties
similar to the Local Group (LG). I develop a scoring system for the LG analogues, introducing
isolation score to the system used by the SIBELIUS project. I find that simulations
whose initial conditions are on nearby iterations of BORG’s Markov chain to a LG analogue,
have an increased probability of producing an analogue themselves. The Markov chain iteration
chosen by SIBELIUS is shown to be unremarkable, however no other iteration stands
out as superior. The properties of the best analogues are shown to be less unique than the
LG’s properties, proving the difficulty in computationally reproducing a LG-like system.
