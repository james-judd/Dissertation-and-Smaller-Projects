A Python script that simulates the movement of a massless body under the gravitational influence of 2 other bodies in circular orbit.\
\
The gravitational constant; masses; initial position of the three bodies; number of orbits simulated; and timesteps per orbit can all be varied.\
\
Includes functions to automatically recurse my simulation to determine the L2 Lagrange Point for the given initial conditions. This is the distance at which the massless object orbits perfectly in-line with the two masses, maintaining a constant orbital radius. The L2 Lagrange point is inherently unstable, meaning that a slight displacement causes the body to fall inwards or be ejected from the system.\
\
See the hashed comments in the code to set up the automation process.
